          <p>I chose to make a collage of my latest design works.</p>

          <p>
            I will accompany this bio with fun facts about me that nobody asked
            for.
          </p>

          <p>
            1) I have a weak spot for cringey romance dramas. I watched
            <em>Twenty-Five Twenty-One</em> during the summer. Though it's not
            as cringey as other dramas that I've watched, I cried happy and sad
            tears after every episode.
          </p>

          <p>
            2) This week, I played badminton for the first time in four years. I
            was rusty but it was so fun! I got some smashes in and thankfully,
            nobody got hurt. Go badminton!
          </p>

          <p>3) I aspire to be a non-perfectionist (imperfectionist?).</p>

          <p>
            4) I love autumn for its colors but at the same time, I don't want
            summer to end because I enjoy it when the sun sets at 8 PM (not any
            earlier than that!).
          </p>

          <p>
            5) Song that's stuck in my head right now:
            <em>If you're feeling down I just wanna make you happier... ♪♩</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            6) This semester is my last one at Concordia. Honestly, I'm not
            ready to leave yet. I met many awesome people and enjoy learning.
            Saying goodbye is hard.
